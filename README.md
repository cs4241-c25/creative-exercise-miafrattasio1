## Valentine's Day Card
- Link: https://creative-exercise-miafrattasio1.glitch.me/
- For this assignment, I chose to explore Canavs
- With Valentine's day coming up, I chose to create a Valentine, with a pun about puzzles. I used half circles and rectangles to make the puzzle pieces, and half circles with a triangle to make the heart. I put a gradient box behind the words. 
- I read through the rectangle, triangle, half circle, gradient, text, and canvas intro tutorials on the W3 Schools Canvas tutorials, however I wrote all my code on my own after reading and completing the examples on the webpage.
- Here are some of the links I checked out before making my Valentine:
